<h1>Active Directory Lab Setup</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
As a penetration tester, something a lot of recruiters are looking for is experience in testing within an Active Directory environment. It may be hard to find vulnerable machines that replicate a real world enviroment with Active Directory vulnerabilities. There are definitely some that teach you the basics such as Kerberoasting, ASREP-Roasting, SAM dumps, NTDS.dits dump, etc., but they don't prepare you for pivoting through an AD network on your way to gaining Domain Admin. The best and free method to do this is by creating your own lab. I'll get you started by creating a domain controller and users and all that's left is to connect other devices to the network and make them vulnerable in any method you see fit.
